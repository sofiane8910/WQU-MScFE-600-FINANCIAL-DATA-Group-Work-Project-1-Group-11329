Not all data is created in an ethical, straightforward, complete, and forthright manner. Just as we need to apply critical thinking to assess the quality, accuracy, and completeness of data, we should also use good ethical practices when we provide data to others or use it in our own models. This lesson will consider a dozen unethical practices associated with data.

Ethics are an important part of finance. Firms like to include ethics in training their employees. Indeed, one of the largest accounting firms in the world administered an ethics exam to its employees. It turns out that the employees cheated on their ethics exam! The firm itself failed to disclose this information to the regulatory board (GaNun).

This lesson deals with ethical issues as they apply to the handling of data. Each subsection describes one of the unethical ways people handle data inappropriately: investing, exaggerating, distorting, inappropriately collecting, hiding, misconstruing, etc. Each includes at least one real-world example of behavior undertaken by an individual, company, or even a market.

1. Intentionally Creating Misleading Data
One day, an artist named Simon Weckert collected 99 smart phones (Barret). He put them into a wagon that he then proceeded to walk along the streets of Munich, ironically the street near Google headquarters in Munich—-he was hacking the Google Maps app! About an hour into his walk, Google Maps showed long, snarling traffic—despite there not being any cars in the area. The artist claims he was pointing out the simplicity behind these systems. There was really no harm done in this clever prank. This makes us question our assumptions when we receive data, like traffic conditions.

If this exercise were done in financial markets, it would be an entirely different story. It is unethical to intentionally create misleading data. Just as we may automatically follow the conditions on a traffic app, a RoboAdvisor may automatically follow the conditions in the marketplace (D'Acunto and Rossi). They may react without questioning data because they focus on speed and efficiency rather than authenticating the results.

One egregious way to intentionally mislead a market is to spoof it. One such person who did that in 2010 was Navinder Singh Sarao. He was held responsible for initiating a market downturn known as the Flash Crash of 2010. Sarao pled guilty to spoofing the market and paid with a prison sentence and fines.

What is spoofing? Spoofing is an extreme type of bluff. Spoofing occurs when a trader places a large order that he has no intention of getting filled. Instead, the intention is to manipulate the market in one's favor. For example, a spoofer placing a large buy order would place a huge bid order well below the current market bid price. When market makers and other traders, including algorithmic traders, sense a motivated buyer, they pull their ask prices and raise them. These price increases trigger other traders to do the same. Yet, this was the spoofer’s motive all along—a manipulation of price in the desired direction.

In Mr. Sarao’s case, he spoofed the market by placing a large sell order (above the ask price) for the E-mini S&P futures contract. His order caused the algorithms to lower their prices, which in turn caused other traders and algorithms to lower their prices, and so on. Prices plummeted. The actions and reactions caused the Flash Crash, an intraday market crash that wiped out more than $1 trillion in market value. Other markets did not exhibit the drop, and so the market learned that this was a one-off accident. Within the hour, most of the market corrected.

It is unethical to crate misleading data. Markets trade in real time and can be misled by spoofers. Fortunately, regulation and greater controls exist at many exchanges today that minimize the reoccurrence of a trader spoofing the market and causing another flash crash. It is still a criminal offense to spoof the market.

2. Propagating Fake Reviews
Next time you’re in London, you may want to dine at what was once the top-rated restaurant on tripadvisor.com: The Shed (Butler). With pictures of dishes, an outside garden, and dozens of reviews, The Shed seemed to be the trendy place to eat. The only problem is that the restaurant didn’t exist. The initial reviews were all fake. Ironically, The Shed was the go-to place. Phone calls into the restaurant only made it to the answering machine. When people realized how trendy the restaurant was, they wrote reviews even though they never even went there. Part of the momentum of going viral was hiring celebrities that posed with dishes (that weren’t even from the restaurant) to lend an air of credibility and panache.

Reading reviews is not the same as performing due diligence. As more details of the FTX scandal become public, some celebrities are coming forward to admit that they were investors. Many people are familiar with the movie star Kevin Bacon. He was an investor in FTX and claims he lost millions of dollars. Even celebrities can become victims of the halo effect or appeal to authority. Marketers know the power of celebrity endorsements, to the point where many athletes and musicians earn millions more from product endorsements than they earn in wages.

Do you wonder how many restaurant reviews are fake? There are parties with vested interests who are tempted to post glowing review after glowing review. A quick click into that reviewer shows they reviewed nothing else. The same can be said for forums that review stocks. Some people join these popular forums to tout stocks (or to bash them if they have short positions). Good ethics avoids misrepresentation.

3. Failing to Disclose Fees or Conflicts of Interest
According to a data survey by the data research company Morning Consult, only 36% of adults trusted investment and wealth managers. The rest either did not trust them or had no opinion about them. Part of the problem is that financial advisors fail to disclose fees or reveal conflicts of interest. For example, an advisor may recommend a mutual fund A over B for a client. Although B may be more suitable for the investment profile and risk tolerance, the advisor is paid a much better commission for selling mutual fund A. Failing to disclose fees or reveal conflicts of interest violates a fiduciary trust.

In the investment world, these are criminal activities. For example, two robo-advisors, one which had more than $11 billion in client money, made false statements about a strategy involving tax-loss harvesting (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, "SEC Charges Two Robo-Advisers"). These false disclosures misled investors into thinking the funds had superior performance (higher returns, less risk, smaller fees) and naturally makes them appear more attractive than other funds. Other times, managers fail to disclose fees (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, "SEC Charges Investment Adviser").

Good ethics show all data associated with investment: historical results, fees, and risks. Regulation helps. Some industries protect the consumer/investor better than others.

4. Using Simulated Data Instead of Real Data without Explicit Disclosure
Another way to lie with data is to use simulated data while trying to pass it off as real data. For example, a hedge fund raised millions of dollars by falsely claiming that it had a lengthy track record based on actual trades using real money (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, "SEC Charges Father-and-Son Hedge Fund Managers"). In reality, the results were from back-tested hypothetical simulations. Simulations have details that can skew a study one way or another. For example, a simulation of a back-test may ignore a bid-ask spread and market impact. Misrepresenting the type of data is illegal, and the managers agreed to pay millions to settle the fraud case. Using simulated returns in and of itself is not illegal or unethical. When using simulated data, you should clearly indicate that the results are not real, but merely a product of back-tests or scenarios. Even when a fund has a track record going back years, a disclaimer is added that past performance is no guarantee of future results. Misleading is lying.

5. Adding Good Data to Bad Data
Student cheating is well known, but there is also something called teacher cheating. This story was described in Levitt and Dubner's book Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything. To make their own teaching appear more effective, some teachers in Chicago cheated by adding points to students' tests. When students submitted their test papers, the teachers would fill in the last few questions correctly, as most students didn’t attempt to answer the hard questions due to lack of time or difficulty. So these teachers could take a student's exam paper and spend a few seconds improving the score. The teachers did not spend any time erasing answers, but did spend time on filling in a memorized pattern of multiple-choice responses for the last few questions, which most students never attempted. Overall, the teacher cheating seemed to work: the scores of students improved! But there were some inconsistent statistics about performance that raised red flags. Many students incorrectly answered easy and medium questions yet got a sequence of difficult questions correct. Moreover, nearly all the students in a classroom got the same exact difficult questions correct. The coincidences were astounding. Further investigation showed there was an incentive for teachers: improved test scores meant more money for teachers.

In banking, the stakes are higher, and the methods are much more sophisticated. Benford’s Law is used to detect accounting data manipulation in the banking industry. Benford’s law predicts the relative frequencies of digits. Please read the paper by Grammatikos and Papanikolaou to learn how Benford’s Law was applied to detect accounting data manipulation in the banking industry. One might think a small percentage of good data would go unnoticed. Good ethical practice is to not interfere with data quality.

6. Hiding Data
Instead of adding good data to bad data, why not hide some data altogether? That’s what was done in the case of some public debt. Horn describes the systematic underreporting of public debt. The study includes data from 50 years. In strong economies, hiding debt is easy. However, in bad economic times, hidden debts are likely to be exposed. Hiding debt can make politicians, comptrollers, or budgets look better than they are, and politicians may make promises that can help get them re-elected but won't make good on them when the true revenues and expenses are tallied.

Good intentions may cause people to hide data. If you were removing outliers from a distribution, that may seem to be reducing noise, improving the overall results. Yet, what one person considers to be an outlier, the other may consider to be an important extreme case. Likewise, on a "thin trading day" (a day with very little liquidity), one may consider the bid-ask spread to be non-representative of overall liquidity. However, these illiquid periods need to be included in models that measure liquidity and overall risk.

Other times, data may be biased and skew results. Suppose a restaurant provides a feedback form only to repeat customers. Presumably, a repeat customer enjoyed their experience and revisits the establishment. However, what about a one-time customer who did not have a good experience? They are denied the chance to receive a feedback form in the first place. Of course, many online websites (such as Yelp) offer the opportunity for dissatisfied customers to express their views.

7. Smoothing Data
Smoothing sounds like a good thing. In Econometrics, you will smooth time series to filter out noise. However, smoothing profit-and-loss (P and L) makes data appear less risky than it really is. Smoothing under-reports volatility. Underreporting volatility is a common phenomenon at alternative funds or funds that trade in securities that don’t have clear, liquid, mark-to-market pricing (Le Marois). Granted, if a security hasn’t traded in months or is difficult to value because of a lack of fungibility, it is hard to provide accurate marks. If volatility is understated, then Sharpe ratios are overstated. For example, suppose a strategy earns the fund manager the following daily returns: +5, -1, +1, -3. The manager could turn the +5 into a +1, holding back a reserve of 4. That reserve could flatten the -3 entirely and mitigate the -2 to a -1, so instead of having swings of up 5 and down 3, the strategy reports +1, 0, +1, 0. This looks very good: small wins and no losses. Taken to scale, holding back gains for offsetting losses will lower the volatility of a strategy. Good ethics avoids smoothing.

8. Extrapolating Data
Extrapolating data is a problem. Some models have linear regions and then quickly change to non-linear. Think market impact. Previously in this course, we saw the problem associated with the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Sadly, the analysis shows that the 20-degree decrease in temperature (which reflects the temperature conditions on launch day) increases the odds of failing by 15-fold. Good ethical practice is to ensure predicted results are not outside the region of testing. See the article ByUiStats here: https://byuistats.github.io/Statistics-Notebook/Analyses/Logistic%20Regression/Examples/challengerLogisticReg.html

The danger of extrapolating is assuming that the trend will continue outside the region of predictors where it was tested. If a system is linear, then extrapolation would not create problems. The challenge of non-linearity makes it dangerous to assume trends continue outside the test region.

9. Stealing Data
Companies have data stolen. Some of this data may contain important customer information, which is used to hack into their accounts, draining them of funds or setting up new identities in their names. In other cases, it is copyrighted, patented, or trademarked. In previous lessons, we saw employees who took data (and code) from companies. Read Chang et al. to see the effect of data theft on a firm’s market value.

10. Data Quality Problems
You’ve heard the acronym GIGO: Garbage In, Garbage Out. Yet, how do we know we have garbage in the first place? Although not a straight ethical issue, some data is of poor quality. If you knew data had quality problems but still modeled it extensively and reported on the results, you propagate the quality issue. A model's rigor and formality does not improve the quality of data that is questionable from the start (see Liu for more info).

One way data quality issues are avoided is by requiring audited financial statements. The scrutiny of a professional accounting firm provides reliability and trust in the reported results. Consider the case of the world's largest rental car company, Hertz. Several years ago, the SEC charged Hertz with inaccurate data reporting (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, "SEC Charges Hertz"). Hertz itself had to pay a fine. But what about the institutional investors who made investment decisions about Hertz based on this information? Clearly, the news about the misrepresentation was not known at the time. Those with a fiduciary responsibility should take great care to assess the quality of data they have before they build models and make decisions.

11. Collecting Data without Permission
Smartphone apps like data. Many of them collect our data, even without our permission. There is now a field focused on data privacy laws that protect consumers, app users, etc. from companies collecting and reselling their data (Klosowski). The problem is that this data can be used in ways the user never intended.

Good ethics gets explicit permission to store user data. This disclosure is usually part of a license agreement but can get easily get lost in the fine print.

12. Disclosing Data without Permission
Disclosing data without permission is even worse. This means your usage data is sent to companies and third parties without your permission or knowledge. Moreover, what if there's a data breach? There have been major companies whose data banks have been hacked, making people’s sensitive information available to criminals.

As you can see, data has its own set of ethics. With more types of data available (think of all the alternative data used in finance), the increased number of accounts people have (with banks, brokerages, exchanges, advisors, apps, etc.), there is more data than ever.

13. Conclusion
Just as we ended the FM course discussing ethics, we end the FD course discussing ethics around data. We repeat that reputations are slow to build on the positive side but quick to tumble on the negative side. Decades of diligent, ethical practice can be outweighed by a single act of unethical behavior. Unfortunately, the internet has no ability to forget. Thanks to Instagram pictures, Facebook posts, blogs, YouTube videos gone viral, and news articles that never disappear, stories of unethical behavior have no expiration date.

The stories we have heard—insider trading, fabricating emails, spoofing markets—have turned relatively obscure people into internet memes. Google searches reveal thousands of pages on these people who are known to the world for their infamous act. The opportunity cost is quite high. Many people will avoid working with or hiring these people because of a known track record of dishonesty and deceit. Practice good ethics--in data and in action.
